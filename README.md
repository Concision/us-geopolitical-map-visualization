# U.S. Geopolitical Map Visualization
This project was created in a day for a college assignment in a data visualization course. As such, the datasets used are primarily processed in the browser and have rather poor performance.

The project can be viewed [here](https://concision.github.io/us-geopolitical-map-visualization/src/).
