                <p>
                    For this project, I wanted to create some form of map that changed with respect to time. The dataset
                    I selected was U.S. geopolitical data relating to congressional districts; this presented a few
                    requirements for visual encoding and interactivity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An interactive method to scroll through time needs to be available and easy to use</li>
                    <li>Political parties for each district needs to be visually encoded and easy to interpret</li>
                    <li>Relative voting power for each district needs to be visually encoded</li>
                    <li>An interactive method to view a district's detailed information on demand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To satisfy these requirements, I did the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defined thicker stroke widths to states and land borders, and thinner for district borders</li>
                    <li>Encoded two main political parties in congressional districts with their color (Blue Democrats,
                        Red Republicans, Gray other)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added a legend to map political party colors to their respective name</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Encoded relative voting power for each congressional district by shading the alpha channel</li>
                    <li>A tooltip when hovering over a congressional district that supplies details-on-demand</li>
                    <li>Added an interactive/controllable slider that controls time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>I chose to not have any team members, as I was more interested in learning every component of this
                    project. The development process was very agile - there was a significant amount of tweaking various
                    encoding variables (color, shading normalization, stroke thickness, etc).</p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the project took approximately 14 hours to execute, which is broken down into more detail
                    below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>2</b> hours thinking of a question that has a usable dataset</li>
                    <li><b>1</b> hour sourcing geographic and political datasets for the past 4 decades</li>
                    <li><b>3</b> hours converting, simplifying, and applying quantization to geographic map datasets
                    </li>
                    <li><b>6</b> hours building a visualization</li>
                    <li><b>2</b> hours formatting and writing up report</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Geographic congressional district data was sourced from University of California, Los Angeles's <a
                        href="http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/">United States Congressional District Shapefiles</a>,
                    which provided the districts in ERSI shapefiles.<br>
                    Historical candidate and political party affiliations were sourced from <a
                        href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2/Y1WLPQ&version=5.0">MIT
                    Election Data</a>'s dataset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most significantly difficult part of the assignment was obtaining geopolitical map data for the
                    past 4 decades and converting it to a format that was useful. The sourced map data was over 2 GiB
                    before I processed it; at the end, it was 26 MiB, and 1.2 MiB when GZIP compressed by NGINX on
                    GitHub pages. This dataset can be further compressed by storing only distinct congressional
                    districts, as some districts were valid for multiple congressional elections. With more time spent
                    on the project, geopolitical map data and candidate history could have been highly optimized and
                    compressible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This visualization is not very performant in browsers due to unoptimized transitions between years;
                    it re-renders all districts, even though they might not have changed. As such, certain features,
                    such as zooming and panning, were cut out due to how CPU intensive they were.
